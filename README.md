# PTS: Processing Topology Suite

A library for manipulating PShape geometry

PTS wraps JTS, enabling its methods to be applied to Processing's `PShape` objects. Beyond that, PTS provides other geometry __ such as splines.

## Morphology

### PShapes

- Boolean operations: union, difference, intersection, etc.
- Shape Boundaries
- Smoothing
- Simplification
- Area, centroid, etc.

### Fields

- Voronoi
- Poisson-Disc
